# Background Color Maker ðŸŽ¨

A simple color picker app that lets you choose one or two colors  
to create a solid background or a gradient.

## Features

- Switch between 1-color and 2-color mode  
- Live preview of background color  
- Gradient background when two colors are selected  
- Minimal and responsive design

## Design Note âœ¨

The UI is intentionally semi-transparent, allowing it to blend smoothly with any background color or gradient you choose.  
This subtle design choice enhances the harmony between the interface and background, while keeping text readable â€” even with light color tones.

Enjoy the seamless experience of color exploration.
